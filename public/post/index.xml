      <description>Para el siguiente análisis se tomaron plugs de 1.5” de diámetro cortados de núcleos de un Pozo x a diferentes profundidades. Los Datos se obtuvieron de la medición de volumen poroso y permeabilidad para las presiones de Confinamiento de 800, 1700, 2100 y 2400 psi mediante el equipo Porosimetro y Permeatro CMS400.
OBJETIVO RESULTADOS Analizar los resultados obtenidos para la medición de porosidad y permeabilidad para muestras de un pozo x, el objetivo principal es la utilización de bucles y funciones para encontrar las profundidades a las cuales la medición en el equipo presenta un valor atípico de incremento de Vp o K con el aumento de la presión de confinamiento.</description>

      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of
this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on

listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined
to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>
